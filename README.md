# 🍃 Text Fade Away (Type & Release)

> "Type something and press Enter to watch it fade away..."

**Text Fade Away** is a minimalist, therapeutic web application designed to help users visualize the act of "letting go." Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features fluid animations where text floats up, blurs, and dissolves into particles, accompanied by ambient visual effects.
